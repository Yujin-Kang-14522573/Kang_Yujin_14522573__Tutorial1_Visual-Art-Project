**Interactive Orchid Art Project**
**Overview**
This project is an interactive digital artwork inspired by traditional Korean orchid paintings, created using Processing. The artwork captures the fluid, organic brushstrokes characteristic of Korean ink paintings, combining cultural symbolism with modern digital interactivity. The orchid's leaves are rendered with bezier curves, and the piece incorporates dynamic, mouse-driven interactions, allowing users to explore and engage with the artwork in real-time.

**Features**
  **Organic Leaf Shapes:** The orchid leaves are designed using bezier curves to replicate the natural, flowing forms of real orchid petals, inspired by traditional brushwork.
  **Interactive Elements:** The artwork responds to mouse movement:
    **Mouse Position:** The orchidâ€™s leaves adjust their color based on mouseX and mouseY coordinates, creating an engaging, dynamic effect.
    **Random Background Changes:** Clicking the mouse triggers a random background color change, adding an element of surprise while maintaining harmony with the monochromatic theme.

These interactive features make the artwork feel responsive and immersive, blending tradition with modern digital techniques.

**How to Run**
  **1. Install Processing:** Ensure Processing is installed on your computer. You can download it from Processing.org.
  **2. Download the Code:** Clone or download the project files.
  **3. Run the Sketch:** Open the main .pde file in Processing and click the Run button.

**Code Explanation**
  **Bezier Curves:** Used to create smooth, natural-looking orchid leaves by adjusting control points.
  **Mouse Interaction:**
      - **mouseX and mouseY** adjust the color of the orchid in real-time based on the cursor's position.
      - **mousePressed()** triggers a random background color change using the random() function, keeping the artwork fresh and engaging.
  **Color Dynamics:** The color scheme is monochromatic, maintaining visual harmony and evoking the calm, meditative quality of traditional Korean art.

**Future Enhancements**
In future iterations, additional features could include layered animations, 3D elements, or more complex interactivity to create an even richer user experience.
