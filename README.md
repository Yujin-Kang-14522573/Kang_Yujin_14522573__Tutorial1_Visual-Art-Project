## General Info
The **Interactive Orchid Art Project** is a digital interactive artwork inspired by traditional Korean orchid paintings. Created using the Processing programming environment, it captures the fluid and organic qualities of traditional ink brushwork through bezier curves, color dynamics, and mouse interaction. The artwork merges cultural symbolism with modern technology, enabling users to engage with it through dynamic, real-time interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Processing** - A flexible software sketchbook and a language tailored for the visual arts, ideal for creating interactive digital art.
- **Java-based Processing API** - Provides core functions for visuals, event handling, and color manipulation.

## Features
- **Bezier Curves for Organic Shapes**: The orchid leaves are drawn with bezier curves, achieving smooth and natural forms that emulate traditional brushwork.
- **Interactive Color and Movement**:
  - **Mouse Position-Based Color Shifts**: The orchid’s colors dynamically adjust based on the mouse’s x and y coordinates.
  - **Random Background Changes**: Each mouse click triggers a random background color change, introducing a unique visual element with every interaction.
- **Monochromatic Color Scheme**: A serene, meditative color palette evokes the aesthetics of traditional Korean art, keeping focus on form and movement.

## Screenshots

Here is the artwork’s initial view and an example of its dynamic response to mouse interactions.

## Setup
1. **Install Processing**: Download and install Processing from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/).
2. **Download the Code**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. **Run the Sketch**: Open the `.pde` file in Processing and click the **Run** button to launch the artwork.

## Usage
- **Mouse Movement**: Move the mouse across the canvas to adjust the color of the orchid leaves based on `mouseX` and `mouseY` coordinates.
- **Mouse Click**: Click anywhere on the canvas to trigger a random background color change, adding an element of surprise and enhancing interactivity.

## Project Status
The project is complete in its current form. However, there are opportunities for further enhancements, such as incorporating 3D elements or adding additional animation layers.

## Room for Improvement
- **Advanced Interactivity**: Expanding features, such as layered animations or gradual transitions, to enrich the viewer’s experience.
- **3D Elements**: Adding 3D components could bring further depth to the artwork.
- **Refined Color Transitions**: Smoother, more nuanced color transitions would enhance the meditative quality of the artwork.

## Acknowledgements
- **Processing Foundation** - For their extensive resources and tutorials on interactive art and design.
- **Inspiration**: Traditional Korean orchid paintings and digital art platforms like Silk served as inspiration for the concept and design of this project.
